            <h4> Job Experience </h4>
            <strong> January 2018 to date </strong>
            <p>  <b> Highway Institute of Career Development</b>  <br> <em>Computer Networks Tutor </p>

            <h4> Why i decided to take a class on programming??</h4>
            <p>
              <b> ICT </b> is wide. By the time i was doing my Bsc IT program i found it difficult to confine my time in my passion
              ,  <em> Programming</em>. It was not easy to balance between Networks (Both logical and structural), Some Mathematics units and much more. Remember i had to produce results for all the units i took.
               This provided litle time to concentrate in programming. <br>

            <b><u>Moringa</u></b> is an an environment where word class developers are made. I need to be one.
                I know coding will change my world. Not just about apps development.
                Learning to code will provide me with  <i>problem-solving skills</i>
                and a way to communicate with others on a technical level.
                I wanted to be able to develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job.
                And I hope to learn it all at <strong>Moringa</strong>, a place where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated.
