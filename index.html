               Hey! I'm <strong>    Michael</strong>.
               <br>
               <h4> Education Background  </h4>

                <ol>
                   <li><strong> Year 2012. </strong>
                    <em> <b>  East African College of Commerce and Development Studies  </b></em>
                    <br> <i> Certificate in Computer Applications</i>
                  </li></br>

                    <li><strong>  Year 2013-2017.</strong>
                    <em><b> Maseno University </b></em> <br>
                    <i> Bachelor of Science Information Technology </i>
                   </li>

                 </ol> Coding has changed my world.
               It's not just about apps.
                Learning to code have given me <i>problem-solving skills</i>
                and a way to communicate with others on a technical level.
                I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job.
                And I learned it all at <strong>Moringa</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated.
                This is actually where worldclass developers are made.
